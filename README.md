 ### Hii there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

  I’m [**Sushant aKa Sushiee**](), trying to be a full-stack developer with a slight addiction to AI.

  Currently learning how to automate my life with AI and wondering why this one bug keeps reappearing.

  Outside of code, you’ll find me watching anime, either hard stuck in Valo, or pretending to read a book I never finish. Sometimes I even do all three at once. Multitasking? More like multi-escaping.

  #### Fun Facts:

  * Me and coding? It’s a toxic situationship.
  * My side projects have side projects.
  * Fixed a bug by staring at it. Magic? Maybe. Sleep-deprived? Definitely.
